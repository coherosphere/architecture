# Coherosphere Architecture — To-Do List (v4.1)

_Last updated: 2025-11-01_

This document lists the active development and documentation tasks required to reach **v1.0 release readiness** for the Coherosphere architecture.  
It reflects the current state of `/architecture` as verified in November 2025.

---

## 🟧 1. C4 Sequences (Behavioral Flows)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ⚠️ | Finalize `C4-34` | Missing file; sequence definition incomplete. |
| ⚠️ | Fix `C4-35` syntax | The loop/alt structure breaks Mermaid parser; requires cleanup. |
| ✅ | Confirm all 33 others | 33/36 are syntactically valid and aligned with DDD-EVTs. |
| 🔸 | Add “Reverse/Error Paths” to 4 key flows | `C4-02`, `C4-03`, `C4-07`, `C4-10` could include explicit `alt failure` logic. |

---

## 🟧 2. Event Specifications (Specs / JSON Schemas)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ⚠️ | Create JSON Schemas for all DDD events (`DDD-EVT-01…86`) | Store under `/assets/specs/events/`. |
| ⚠️ | Validate schema alignment with sequence events | Each `C4-xx` flow must reference existing schema ID. |
| 🔸 | Auto-generate CloudEvents definitions | Add “source”, “subject”, and “type” fields for each EVT. |
| 🔸 | Export as ZIP for developers (`events-schemas.zip`) | To be linked in `/assets/specs/README.md`. |

---

## 🟧 3. Docs & Publishing

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ⚠️ | Deploy **Docusaurus** to `docs.coherosphere.io` | Initialize with the architecture structure (C1–C4, DDD, Specs). |
| ✅ | Prepare `Manifest.md` (v4) | Completed — consistent, timestamp-free. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/docs/ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_REPORT_v4.md` | Text version of the PDF report for web indexing. |
| 🔸 | Integrate Mermaid rendering plugin | For live diagram preview in Docusaurus. |
| 🔸 | Add OpenAPI viewer | Embed Swagger UI for `/assets/specs/openapi/*.yaml`. |

---

## 🟧 4. CI/CD & Validation

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 🔸 | Implement CI script (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) | Checks ID consistency (C2 ↔ DDD ↔ C4 ↔ SM). |
| 🔸 | Add JSON Schema linting | Validate all event definitions automatically. |
| 🔸 | Include Mermaid syntax validator | Prevent diagram parse errors pre-commit. |
| 🔸 | Nightly build to regenerate Manifest tables | Auto-generate new tables for diagrams, specs, events. |

---

## 🟧 5. AI Build Readiness

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | `AI_BUILD_GUIDE_v4.md` synced with repo | Consistent with the architecture manifest. |
| 🔸 | Automate AI build mapping | Generate mapping between C-IDs and code modules. |
| 🔸 | Define prompts/templates for AI scaffolding | For PoC AI build of each container. |
| ⚠️ | Create integration test harness | So generated code can self-verify structure vs. design. |

---

## 🟧 6. Architecture Assets

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | All diagrams renamed (no timestamps) | Clean, CI-safe. |
| ✅ | Manifest and structure stable | All C1–C4 + DDD integrated. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/diagrams/overview/C4_Layers_Summary.mmd` | One-page visual summary for docs landing page. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/diagrams/overview/Architecture_Stack.mmd` | Vertical stack visualization (C1→C4→DDD→Specs). |

---

## 🟧 7. Infrastructure Alignment

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | Domains allocated | `coherosphere.com`, `app.`, `api.`, `docs.`, `chat.`, `ai.`, `data.` all registered. |
| ⚠️ | Update CORS policy to include new subdomains | Regenerate unified JSON CORS policy. |
| 🔸 | Add DNS configuration manifest | `/assets/specs/DNS_Config.json` replacing old hints file. |
| 🔸 | Ensure all API endpoints under `api.coherosphere.io` | Double-check OpenAPI specs. |

---

## 🟧 8. Optional Enhancements

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 🔸 | Prototype Resonance Simulation Engine | Verify λ (time-decay) and alignment behavior in data model. |
| 🔸 | Add “Resonance Map” visualization | 3D visualization of coherence fields. |
| 🔸 | Integrate “AI Copilot” (chat.coherosphere.io) | Link to semantic retrieval layer (`ai.` domain). |
| 🔸 | Add version metadata to Manifest | Include auto-generated “Last updated” timestamps. |
