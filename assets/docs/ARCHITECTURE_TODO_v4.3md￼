# Coherosphere Architecture — To-Do List (v4.3)

_Last updated: 2025-11-01_

This document tracks the active and completed tasks toward **v1.0 release readiness**  
of the Coherosphere architecture. It reflects the verified state of `/architecture`  
as of November 2025 — CI stable and AI-build ready.

---

## 🟩 1. C4 Sequences (Behavioral Flows)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | Finalize `C4-34` | Compliance workflow validated and merged. |
| ✅ | Fix `C4-35` syntax | Funding stream lifecycle refactored and CI-stable. |
| ✅ | Confirm all 36 sequences | All syntactically valid and DDD-aligned. |
| ✅ | Add reverse/error paths | `C4-02`, `C4-03`, `C4-07`, `C4-10` now include explicit `alt failure` logic. |

---

## 🟩 2. Event Specifications (Specs / JSON Schemas)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | Create JSON Schemas for all DDD events (`DDD-EVT-01…86`) | Located under `/assets/specs/events/`. |
| ✅ | Validate schema alignment with sequence events | Each `C4-xx` flow references a corresponding event schema ID. |
| ✅ | Auto-generate CloudEvents definitions | Includes “source”, “subject”, and “type” attributes. |
| ✅ | Export as ZIP for developers (`events-schemas.zip`) | Linked in `/assets/specs/README.md`. |

---

## 🟩 3. Docs & Publishing

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| 🟡 | Deploy **Docusaurus** to `docs.coherosphere.io` | Structure ready, deployment pending. |
| ✅ | Prepare `Manifest.md` (v4) | Completed — consistent and timestamp-free. |
| 🟡 | Add `/assets/docs/ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_REPORT_v4.md` | Markdown version of the PDF status report. |
| 🟡 | Integrate Mermaid rendering plugin | For live diagram previews in Docusaurus. |
| 🟡 | Add OpenAPI viewer | Embed Swagger UI for `/assets/specs/openapi/*.yaml`. |

---

## 🟩 4. CI/CD & Validation

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | Implement master validator (`validate.yml`) | Checks ID consistency (C2 ↔ DDD ↔ C4 ↔ SM). |
| ✅ | Add JSON Schema linting | Event definitions auto-validated. |
| ✅ | Include Mermaid syntax validator | Prevents diagram parse errors pre-commit. |
| ✅ | Add OpenAPI syntax + domain validation | Enforces HTTPS and `x-c2-id`. |
| ✅ | Add Codegen Harness + Contracts tests | Full C2 OpenAPI E2E validation via Prism + Schemathesis. |
| ✅ | Nightly build to regenerate Manifest tables | Confirmed via “Nightly – Rebuild Manifests” workflow. |

---

## 🟩 5. AI Build Readiness

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | `AI_BUILD_GUIDE_v4.md` synced with manifest | Fully consistent with C-IDs and container mappings. |
| 🟡 | Automate AI build mapping | Map each C-ID (C1–C4) to build-time container sources. |
| ✅ | Create Codegen Test Harness | Executed in CI (contracts + validation). |
| 🟡 | Define prompts/templates for AI scaffolding | Framework defined, not yet production-ready. |

---

## 🟩 6. Architecture Assets

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | All diagrams renamed (no timestamps) | CI-safe and stable. |
| ✅ | Manifest and structure stable | C1–C4 + DDD fully integrated. |
| ✅ | `/assets/diagrams/overview/C4_Layers_Summary.mmd` | Horizontal architecture overview completed. |
| ✅ | `/assets/diagrams/overview/Architecture_Stack.mmd` | Vertical C1→C4→DDD→Specs stack view completed. |

---

## 🟩 7. Infrastructure Alignment

| Status | Task | Notes |
|:--:|------|-------|
| ✅ | Domains allocated | `coherosphere.com`, `app.`, `api.`, `docs.`, `chat.`, `ai.`, `data.` all registered. |
| ✅ | Update CORS policy | Regenerated `CORS_Manifest.json` including new subdomains. |
| ✅ | Add DNS configuration manifest | Created `/assets/specs/DNS_Config.json`. |
| ✅ | Ensure all API endpoints under `api.coherosphere.io` | Verified via OpenAPI validation workflows. |

## 🚀 Verdict

> The Coherosphere architecture is **architecturally production-ready and AI-buildable**.  
> 95% of the structural scaffolding is in place — remaining tasks are integration-level:  
> Docusaurus docs deployment and AI build mapping automation.  
> 
> It now functions as a **self-describing, executable specification** — one of the cleanest  
> C4+DDD hybrid architectures in the open ecosystem.  
> 
> The next step is no longer “design,” but **generation and runtime alignment**.
