# Coherosphere Architecture — To-Do List (v4.2)

_Last updated: 2025-11-01_

This document lists the active development and documentation tasks required to reach **v1.0 release readiness** for the Coherosphere architecture.  
It reflects the current validated state of `/architecture` as of November 2025.

---

## 🟩 1. C4 Sequences (Behavioral Flows)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | Finalize `C4-34` | Missing or incomplete; define sequence logic for Data Subject Request workflow. |
| ✅ | Fix `C4-35` syntax | Minor parse conflict (alt/loop nesting) in Mermaid parser; fix line indentation. |
| ✅ | Confirm all other 34 flows | Validated against DDD-EVT references (84/84 events resolved). |
| ✅ | Add “Reverse/Error Paths” to 4 key flows | Add `alt failure` branches for `C4-02`, `C4-03`, `C4-07`, `C4-10` for clarity. |

---

## 🟩 2. Event Specifications (Specs / JSON Schemas)

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | Create JSON Schemas for all DDD events (`DDD-EVT-01…86`) | Stored under `/assets/specs/events/`. |
| ✅ | Validate schema alignment with sequence events | Each C4 flow now references existing schema IDs (validated via CI). |
| ✅ | Auto-generate CloudEvents definitions | `source`, `subject`, `type` fields generated automatically. |
| ✅ | Export as ZIP for developers (`events-schemas.zip`) | Linked in `/assets/specs/README.md` for downstream use. |

---

## 🟩 3. Docs & Publishing

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ⚠️ | Deploy **Docusaurus** to `docs.coherosphere.io` | Prepare base documentation structure for architecture visualization. |
| ✅ | Prepare `Manifest.md` (v4) | Completed and standardized across all layers. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/docs/ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_REPORT_v4.md` | To be auto-generated nightly for web indexing. |
| 🔸 | Integrate Mermaid rendering plugin | Required for live preview in Docusaurus. |
| 🔸 | Add OpenAPI viewer | Embed Swagger UI for `/assets/specs/openapi/*.yaml`. |

---

## 🟩 4. CI/CD & Validation

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | Implement CI scripts (`validate-arch-*.yml`) | Modular GitHub Actions for C4↔DDD, OpenAPI, Mermaid, and Manifests. |
| ✅ | Add JSON Schema linting | Fully automated via `validate-c4-schemas.yml`. |
| ✅ | Include Mermaid syntax validator | Implemented safely; GitHub syntax differences isolated in `.mermaid_clean`. |
| ✅ | Nightly build to regenerate Manifest tables | Done — **Nightly – Rebuild Manifests** workflow active (manual + cron-ready). |

---

## 🟩 5. AI Build Readiness

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | `AI_BUILD_GUIDE_v4.md` synced with repo | Matches architecture manifests & CI structure. |
| 🔸 | Automate AI build mapping | Map each C-ID (C1–C4) to its source container in build pipeline. |
| 🔸 | Define prompts/templates for AI scaffolding | For autonomous service generation. |
| ⚠️ | Create integration test harness | Allow generated code to self-validate vs. architecture model. |

---

## 🟩 6. Architecture Assets

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | All diagrams renamed (no timestamps) | CI-safe, stable filenames. |
| ✅ | Manifest and structure stable | All C1–C4 + DDD integrated. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/diagrams/overview/C4_Layers_Summary.mmd` | Visual overview for documentation homepage. |
| 🔸 | Add `/assets/diagrams/overview/Architecture_Stack.mmd` | Vertical flow representation (C1→C4→DDD→Specs). |

---

## 🟩 7. Infrastructure Alignment

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| ✅ | Domains allocated | `coherosphere.com`, `app.`, `api.`, `docs.`, `chat.`, `ai.`, `data.` registered. |
| ⚠️ | Update CORS policy to include new subdomains | Regenerate JSON CORS manifest. |
| 🔸 | Add DNS configuration manifest | `/assets/specs/DNS_Config.json`. |
| ✅ | Ensure all API endpoints under `api.coherosphere.io` | Verified via OpenAPI validation CI. |

---

## 🟩 8. Optional Enhancements

| Status | Task | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| 🔸 | Prototype Resonance Simulation Engine | Validate λ (time-decay) in Resonance Service. |
| 🔸 | Add “Resonance Map” visualization | Interactive coherence field viewer. |
| 🔸 | Integrate “AI Copilot” (`chat.coherosphere.io`) | Connects semantic retrieval + governance AI. |
| 🔸 | Add version metadata to Manifest | Include generated “Last updated” timestamps. |
