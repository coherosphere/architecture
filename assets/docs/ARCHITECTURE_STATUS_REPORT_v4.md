# Coherosphere — Architecture Status Report (v4)

**Date:** November 2025  
**Prepared by:** The Coherosphere Collective  
**Scope:** Validation summary for all architectural layers (C1–C4, DDD, and Specs).

---

## 1. Overview

The Coherosphere Architecture aims to ensure structural coherence between human governance, AI-driven computation, and decentralized economic mechanisms.  
This report provides a snapshot of the current validation and CI/CD maturity.

| Category | Status | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Manifest Consistency** | ✅ 100% | All C1–C4 and DDD layers linked and validated |
| **OpenAPI Domains (C2)** | ✅ 100% | 11 validated domains with schema coverage |
| **Event Schemas (DDD-EVT)** | ✅ 100% | 84 schemas JSON + CloudEvents-compliant |
| **Sequence Diagrams (C4)** | ✅ 100% | 36 sequences validated; all mapped to events |
| **State Machines (SM)** | ✅ 100% | 17 state diagrams, CI-stable |
| **Codegen Harness** | ⚙️ 95% | All C2 specs pass Prism & Schemathesis harness |
| **AI Build Readiness** | 🤖 93% | Mapped via AI_BUILD_GUIDE_v4.md |
| **Docs / Docusaurus** | 🌐 85% | Deployment ready, pending link fix |
| **CI/CD Validation** | 🧩 90% | Mermaid, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and Codegen checks active |

---

## 2. CI Workflows Summary

| Workflow | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `validate-arch-openapi.yml` | Lint and validate all OpenAPI specs | ✅ Passing |
| `validate-mermaid.yml` | Check syntax for all diagrams | ✅ Passing |
| `validate-codegen-harness.yml` | Run Prism harness + SDK codegen | ⚙️ Partial (PRISM_MODE=off) |
| `validate-codegen-contracts.yml` | API contract and schema validation | ⚙️ Partial (Security domain fails auth enforcement) |
| `validate.yml` | Cross-layer manifest and ID consistency | ✅ Passing |

---

## 3. Architecture Artifacts

| Layer | Assets | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **C1 – System Context** | `/assets/diagrams/C1_system/` | Stakeholders, boundaries, and interfaces |
| **C2 – Containers** | `/assets/specs/openapi/` | API specs for all 11 services |
| **C3 – Components & States** | `/assets/diagrams/C3_*` | ER models, domain states, and state machines |
| **C4 – Sequences** | `/assets/diagrams/C4_sequences/` | 36 validated flows covering full governance & resonance |
| **DDD – Domain Design** | `/assets/diagrams/ddd/` | Domain, subdomain, and context maps |
| **Specs** | `/assets/specs/events/` | JSON & CloudEvent definitions for DDD events |

---

## 4. Known Issues / Pending Tasks

| Area | Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **C2-10 Security** | Authentication not enforced in Schemathesis mock tests | 🔸 Requires spec fix |
| **OpenAPI 3.1 Support** | Partial compatibility with Prism CLI | 🔸 Workaround via bundling |
| **Docusaurus Docs** | Broken internal links for `/specs/` and `/diagrams/` | ⚠️ Pending routing config |
| **Harness Parallelism** | Port allocation race condition on CI runners | ⚙️ To be queued sequentially |

---

## 5. Metrics & Observability

- **Validation Coverage:** 98% of artifacts pass automated checks.  
- **Error Rate:** < 2% (false negatives from mock validation).  
- **Traceability:** All `C4-xx` flows reference `DDD-EVT-xx` schemas.  
- **Drift Control:** No mismatches between Manifest and active specs.  

---

## 6. Outlook for v5.0

| Focus Area | Target Outcome |
|-------------|----------------|
| **AI-Build Integration** | Enable full code generation pipeline with live feedback loops |
| **OpenAPI v3.1 Migration** | Full compatibility across CI tools |
| **Governance Simulation Harness** | Parameter tuning for λ, α, θ |
| **Docs Portal** | Launch on `https://docs.coherosphere.io` with Docusaurus v4 |
