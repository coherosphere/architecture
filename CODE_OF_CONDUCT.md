# coherosphere Code of Conduct

> “Act in resonance — every action shapes the collective field.”

The Coherosphere is a decentralized collective built on trust, transparency, and alignment.
This Code of Conduct defines how we engage — not through hierarchy, but through coherence.

---

## 1. Purpose

Our goal is to maintain an open, respectful, and collaborative environment where contributors can co-create without fear or prejudice.  
We value diversity of thought, background, and perspective — as long as it strengthens coherence rather than fragmentation.

---

## 2. Our Principles

- **Resonance over Reaction** – Respond thoughtfully; act with awareness of impact.  
- **Integrity over Ego** – Value contribution, not status.  
- **Transparency over Control** – Share information openly unless confidentiality is required for safety.  
- **Respect over Uniformity** – Disagreement is welcome; disrespect is not.  
- **Care over Speed** – Take time to align before acting.

---

## 3. Expected Behavior

- Use welcoming, inclusive language.  
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.  
- Offer constructive feedback rooted in shared purpose.  
- Assume good intent, but stay clear on boundaries.  
- When in doubt, seek alignment through dialogue.

---

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination of any kind.  
- Uninvited contact or sustained disruption in discussions.  
- Manipulation of processes, votes, or metrics.  
- Misrepresentation of the coherosphere or its members.

---

## 5. Scope

This Code applies to all spaces where coherosphere collaboration occurs:  
GitHub repositories, online discussions, documentation, and events.

---

## 6. Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code, please contact:

**Email:** conduct@coherosphere.com 

Reports are handled with confidentiality and empathy.  
The review process follows a **peer-aligned** model — at least two community reviewers assess each case for fairness and transparency.

Violations may result in:
- Private clarification and coaching,  
- Temporary suspension from collaboration, or  
- Removal from participation in extreme cases.

---

## 7. Alignment and Evolution

This Code of Conduct evolves as our understanding of coherence deepens.  
Amendments require community consensus and public versioning.  
The current version is maintained at [github.com/coherosphere/architecture](https://github.com/coherosphere/architecture).
