# 🧭 Architecture Artefacts — coherosphere

This document describes how the **C4 model**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Flow Diagrams** interrelate within the coherosphere architecture.  
Together, they form a coherent multi-layered view: *structure (C4), meaning (DDD), and behavior (Flows).*

---

## 1. The C4 Model — Structural Abstraction

The **C4 model** provides a hierarchy of architectural perspectives.  
It defines *where* elements live within the system, moving from a global to a granular view.

| Level | Focus | Guiding Question | Typical Diagram | Abstraction |
|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **C1 — System Context** | The system and its environment | Who interacts with us? | Actors, external systems, boundaries | 🌍 Strategic |
| **C2 — Container Diagram** | Main deployable building blocks | What services or apps exist? | APIs, databases, UIs, message buses | 🧩 High-level |
| **C3 — Component Diagram** | Internal components of a container | How is this service structured? | Modules, controllers, handlers | ⚙️ Medium |
| **C4 — Code Diagram** | Implementation details | How is the code organized? | Classes, packages, interfaces | 💻 Low-level |

**Summary:**  
> C1–C4 provide the *structural map* of the system — static, spatial, and hierarchical.

## 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) — Semantic Boundaries

**DDD** complements the C4 model by describing the *semantic* and *organizational meaning* of each part.  
It answers the question: **“What does each part *mean* in business or systemic terms?”**

| DDD Concept | Description | Typical C4 Level |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Domain** | A major area of concern (e.g., Governance, Resonance, Identity) | C1 |
| **Bounded Context** | A semantic boundary with its own language and models | C2 |
| **Aggregates / Entities / Services** | The core logic inside a context | C3 |
| **Modules / Classes / Repositories** | Technical implementation | C4 |

**Summary:**  
> DDD gives *semantic meaning* to the structures described by C4.  
>  
> **C4 tells us *where* things are. DDD tells us *what* they mean.**

## 3. Flow Diagrams — Behavioral Dynamics

**Flow diagrams** (e.g., `sequenceDiagram`, `event flow`, or `activityDiagram`) describe the **dynamic behavior** of the system — *how* bounded contexts or components interact over time.

| Type | Focus | Connection to C4/DDD |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **Sequence Diagram** | Temporal order of calls and messages | Behavior between C2 or C3 elements |
| **Event Flow / Process Flow** | Asynchronous communication (publish/subscribe) | Interaction between Bounded Contexts |
| **State Machine / Activity Diagram** | State transitions or workflows | Internal logic within a BC (C3/C4) |

**Summary:**  
> Flows are *dynamic*. They describe the **movement and interaction** between domains and components.

---

## 4. Combined Perspective (C4 + DDD + Flows)

| Layer | Viewpoint | Example in coherosphere |
|--------|------------|--------------------------|
| **C1 — System Context** | Global ecosystem | coherosphere interacting with external chains, users, and networks |
| **C2 — Containers / Bounded Contexts** | Major domains | Governance BC, Contribution BC, Treasury BC, Identity BC, Metrics BC |
| **C3 — Components** | Internal structure | Resonance Engine, KPI Aggregator, Command Handler |
| **C4 — Code** | Implementation | `ContributionHandler`, `DecayFunction`, `SRIService` |
| **DDD — Meaning** | Semantic layer | Defines Ubiquitous Language and Domain Events per context |
| **Flows — Dynamics** | Behavioral layer | Sequence: Contribution → Resonance → Funding → Governance Feedback |

---

## 5. Conceptual Summary

> 🧭 **C4** — Topology (*where things are*)  
> 🧩 **DDD** — Semantics (*what they mean*)  
> 🔁 **Flows** — Dynamics (*how they interact*)

Or more intuitively:

```
C4      = Map
DDD     = Language
Flows   = Movement
```

Together they enable **structural clarity, semantic coherence, and behavioral transparency** across the coherosphere architecture.
