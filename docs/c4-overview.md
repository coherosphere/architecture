# C4 Overview

**C4** = **Context → Containers → Components → Code** (Simon Brown).  
Goal: enable anyone to understand system structure by zooming one level at a time.

- **C1 System Context:** people & external systems
- **C2 Containers:** internal services & data stores
- **C3 Components:** main components within a service
- **C4 Code (optional):** implementation/class diagrams

Why C4:
- Top-down consistency · Language-agnostic · Zoomable · Documentation-first
