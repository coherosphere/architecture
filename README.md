# coherosphere architecture (C4)

This repository is the single source of truth for the Coherosphere architecture,
using the **C4 model**: **Context → Containers → Components → Code**.

- **Level 1 – System Context**  
  Who uses the system, what other systems does it interact with?  
  See: docs/c4-level1-system-context.md
- **Level 2 – Containers**  
  What subsystems/services exist and how do they communicate?  
  See: docs/c4-level2-container.md
- **Level 3 – Components**  
  Internals of key services (Resonance, Governance).  
  See: docs/c4-level3-resonance.md, docs/c4-level3-governance.md

> All diagrams are authored in Mermaid and render directly on GitHub.
